# Ivern
A basic League of Legends tool that allows users to search for basic information on their previous 5 ranked matches.

Please note that this does not display extensive information about each match. While each bit of information is stored, the emphasis was placed on starting out with the basics.  

Also, you must supply your own Riot API key from their website.  I cannot leave my key in or else they can revoke it.

If you want to, please feel free to make your own changes based on this code, and please let me know via email if you decide to work on it! I would love to see this code improved, and see what others have done to it.

Since this was my first project with Go, I may extend its capabilities in the future, but for now it's done :)
