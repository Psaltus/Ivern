A basic League of Legends tool that allows users to search for basic information on their previous 5 ranked matches.

Please note that this does not display extensive information about each match. While each bit of information is stored, the emphasis was placed on starting out with the basics.  

If you want to, please feel free to make your own changes based on this code, and please let me know via eamil if you decide to work on it! I would love to see this code improved, and see what others have done to it.
